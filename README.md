# Heavier Horizons (Formerly Small Inconveniences)
**A Minecraft Mod made for Hack Club's Hackcraft YSWS and Summer of Making**

_Originally meant to be a mod that added gameplay tweaks, hence, the name "Small Inconveniences", but after making steel, the project kinda spiraled out of control and became a steel mod._

Heavier Horizons is a minecraft mod focused on implementing steel and other special tools.

Steel is a new material in between iron and diamonds that requires a bit more work to get. You  make steel using a steel mill and input iron, coal, and coal dust. Steel armor has the same protection as diamond, at the cost of being significantly less durrable. Additionally, tools are efficent as iron tools, just having more durability. With steel, you can also craft a few more special items such as a steel magnet and a forge pickaxe to aid you in gameplay. Lastly, a global gamerule is implemented to enforce the "weight" of armor by slowing down players with more armor.
