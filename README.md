# Heavier Horizons (Formerly Small Inconveniences)
**A Minecraft Mod made for Hack Club's Hackcraft YSWS and Summer of Making**

_Originally meant to be a mod that added gameplay tweaks, hence, the name "Small Inconveniences", but after making steel, the project kinda spiraled out of control and became a steel mod._
